# AISpec

A software-development harness for Claude Code: four lanes, four agents, one kernel, and a benchmark that measures the harness itself.

Code decides what code can decide. Lane admission, the next action, phase verification, verdict routing and cost all come from `node .claude/bin/harness.mjs <verb>`; the model fills in what remains. State is the filesystem: one directory per work item under `work/<id>/`, read fresh on every call, never remembered.

## Lanes

| Lane | When | Who | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| fast (`expediting`) | at most 3 files, no new surface, dependency, security path or migration | main session | tests, lint, drive, commit |
| order (`ordering`) | a bounded feature, at most 3 phases and 5 local decisions | architect, developer, reviewer | one user gate per phase (run grants allowed), one cumulative review |
| design (`designing`) | security path, migration, irreversible step, cross-repo contract, or more than an order holds | architect, developer, reviewer | decisions plus phase 1 first, concurrent cross-check, per-phase gates, checkpoint on long plans, cumulative review |
| research (`researching`) | a question that needs a report | analyst | outline first, deep pass on request |

`harness admit --text "<request>"` picks the lane deterministically from the text and a repository probe, and re-checks it against the files actually touched.

## Layout

```
CLAUDE.md                  under 2 KB, loaded on every turn
.claude/rules/             path-scoped rules: work-items, security-paths, harness-authoring, prose
.claude/agents/            analyst, architect, developer, reviewer (shells, at most 120 lines)
.claude/skills/            lane skills, consulting, documenting, reviewing, ticketing, branching,
                           understanding, proofreading, summarizing, benchmarking, resuming, inspecting
.claude/bin/harness.mjs    the kernel CLI; .claude/lib/ its modules (no runtime dependencies)
.claude/hooks/             nine hooks: guards, schema lint, drive observer, stall monitor, verdict router, ledger
work/<id>/                 state.yaml, the lane artifact, phase markers, verdicts.jsonl
bench/                     golden task suite, fixture repo, runner, reporter (see bench/README.md)
test/                      kernel, hook and budget tests: npm test
```

## Benchmarks

`node bench/run.mjs --harness <trunk|rework> --tasks all --runs 5` runs the 14 golden tasks against a harness in fresh fixture repos with a scripted approver, grades by code, and `node bench/report.mjs <baseline> <candidate> --check` reports pass@1, pass^k, route agreement, cost and variance, time to first reviewable output, stops, prompts, re-reads and cache hit ratio, failing on a regression past two standard errors. Every run spends real API budget: dry-run first.

## Status

PLAN.md carries the plan, the research it rests on, the status table and the 2026-09-11 head-to-head against trunk (section 4.1); `bench/results/comparison.md` is the full report. Headline: 14 of 14 tasks pass against trunk's 13, every task on its intended lane against 57%, first reviewable output 106 s against 130 s, cache 97% against 91%, 2.4 permission prompts per task against 3.1, at the same cost per task ($3.35 against $3.37); the fast lane costs $1.23 per task against $1.59.
