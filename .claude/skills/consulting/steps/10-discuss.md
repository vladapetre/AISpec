# Consulting, step 1: discuss

Read, in one batch and bounded by the question: `.claude/MEMORY.md` (the glossary and decision log), any report or design record the user named (else the newest `work/*/report.md` if one plainly frames the question), and the strategic artifacts under `artifacts/strategy/` whose contexts appear in the question (charters in full, context maps that overlap, SDRs by status and `## Decision`).

Frame the question in your own words. When your framing differs from the user's, say so before answering; the job is to challenge thin reasoning, not to rephrase it.

Surface the alternatives worth weighing: two to four. For each, the name (Evans, Vernon, Team Topologies, Wardley, or the recognised industry practice), the gain, the sacrifice at portfolio level, and any `[IRREVERSIBLE]` consequence.

Recommend one, tied to the binding strategic constraints (investment posture, team topology, time to market, regulatory exposure, reversibility). When the user pushes on a constraint, score explicitly: High, Medium, Low against the signals you can name, and show the table.

Name the blocking unknowns and ask one focused question for each, with your recommended default.

Capture as you go: a resolved term goes into `.claude/MEMORY.md` under the glossary with the business definition first and the implementation pointer second; a non-trivial decision (hard to reverse, surprising without context, the outcome of a real trade-off) goes under `## Decisions` with the date. Do not batch captures to the end.

Emit the output block from `SKILL.md`. Offer ratification only if a direction was reached.
