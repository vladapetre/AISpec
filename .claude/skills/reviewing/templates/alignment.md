# Template: Alignment Check

**Purpose:** Verify that every acceptance criterion in the plan phase is satisfied by the implementation. This is a mechanical mapping exercise — not a quality judgement.

## Caps and overflow

| Field | Cap | Overflow path |
|---|---|---|
| Alignment-table rows per phase | **≤15 acceptance criteria** | Past 15, the phase was too large and should have been split by the architect. The reviewer evaluates the 15 highest-priority criteria (FAIL-eligible first, then UNCLEAR, then PASS candidates) and emits `ARCHITECT AMENDMENT NEEDED: phase too large — N criteria exceed cap` alongside the verdict. |

The cap is on the table, not on the criteria the architect may write — the plan's own per-phase cap (`templates/plan.md`, 3–8 criteria) is what keeps phases reviewable. This row gives the reviewer a deterministic procedure when an over-sized phase reaches them anyway.

## How to apply

1. Extract every bullet or sub-item listed under "**Done when:**" in the current phase.
   - Each bullet is led by its `T-<phase>.<seq>` ID — record the ID verbatim; the alignment table's first column carries it.
   - If the plan uses a different acceptance section label (e.g., "Acceptance criteria", "Exit criteria"), use that instead.
   - If a phase has no typed IDs (template drift — older plan), this review treats the bullets in their source order as `T-N.1`, `T-N.2`, ... and adds a Major finding flagging the plan for the architect to backfill IDs.

2. For each criterion, find the code evidence:
   - A function, method, class, or module that implements it.
   - A test assertion that verifies it.
   - A configuration entry or schema definition that satisfies it.

3. Classify:
   - **PASS** — evidence exists and fully satisfies the criterion. Both the "what" and the "how" must match. Example: if the criterion says "returns HTTP 404 when resource not found", the evidence must be a 404 response — a 400 or an exception is a FAIL.
   - **FAIL** — evidence is absent, covers only part of the criterion, or contradicts it.
   - **UNCLEAR** — the criterion uses words like "should", "consider", "as needed", or "if applicable" without defining a concrete condition. Do not attempt to interpret these — mark UNCLEAR and surface to the architect for clarification.

4. Populate the alignment table in the review output. Fixed columns, in this order:

   ```
   | Criterion | Result | Evidence | Note |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | T-N.1 — <criterion text from the plan> | PASS / FAIL / UNCLEAR | file:line or test name | one short clause |
   ```

   The `Criterion` cell quotes the ID followed by an em-dash and the criterion text from the plan — never paraphrase.

## Alignment-specific severity rules

Partial satisfaction of an acceptance criterion is **FAIL** on the alignment row — the criterion has not been fully met, so the row blocks approval. Independently, the diff-level gap (missing edge case, untested branch) may also be recorded as a Major finding in the adversarial code-review section; the two are different findings about the same gap.

| Finding | Alignment row | Code-review severity |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Criterion fully satisfied with cited evidence | **PASS** | (no finding) |
| Criterion ambiguous (uses "should", "consider", "as needed") | **UNCLEAR** — blocks approval; surface to architect | (no finding) |
| Criterion partially satisfied (core behaviour present, edge case missing) | **FAIL** — blocks approval | **Major** — note the diff-level gap; not the alignment finding |
| Criterion absent or contradicted | **FAIL** — blocks approval | **Critical** if the missing behaviour is the criterion's core, **Major** otherwise |

## Evidence quality rules

Evidence must be direct and traceable:

| Evidence type | Acceptable |
|---------------|------------|
| `file:line` pointing to the exact implementation | Yes |
| Test function name + assertion | Yes |
| Config key + value | Yes |
| "The whole file was updated" | No — be specific |
| "I assume this is handled elsewhere" | No — find the evidence or mark FAIL |
| "The framework handles this automatically" | Only if the framework's documented behaviour matches the criterion — cite the specific mechanism (middleware, attribute, etc.) |
