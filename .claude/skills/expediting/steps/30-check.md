# Expediting, step 3: check, drive, commit, close

Tests and lint, one command, no permission prompt:

```
node .claude/bin/harness.mjs check --human
```

It runs the detected test and lint commands, logs to `.claude/ledger/check-*.log`, prints the failing tail only and stops at the first red step. Fix and re-run until `CHECK OK`. Never shell-redirect test output yourself.

Drive the changed flow through its real entry point when the change touches one. One command does the whole loop and costs no permission prompt:

```
node .claude/bin/harness.mjs drive --hit "GET /invoices?page=2" --human   # start on a free port, hit, stop, restore, log
node .claude/bin/harness.mjs drive --run "npm run cli -- list" --human    # a CLI: run and capture
```

Add one `--hit "POST /path <json>"` per request the change affects; `--start "<cmd>"` overrides the detected start script. Files the drive itself changes (a record the POST created) are restored so the tree stays yours. Read the statuses and bodies it prints; fix and re-run until they match the request. A green suite is not verification. A change with no runtime surface (a pure function, a test, docs) records `no drivable surface: <reason>` instead. Never describe a drive you did not run; the ledger shows the gap.

Fix what the checks find, then stage the touch set, and only stage it:

```
git add -A -- <touched paths> work/<id>
```

Emit the `## Expedited` block from `SKILL.md`, with the commit message you propose on its `Commit:` line and the options line last, and stop. Nothing is committed yet: the user looks at the block and answers.

| Reply | Do |
|---|---|
| `c`, `commit`, `ok`, `yes` | `git commit -m "<the proposed message>"`, then `node .claude/bin/harness.mjs set <id> status=done`; print `committed <sha>` and stop |
| `x <why>`, `discard`, `reject: <why>` | leave the index as it is, print one line saying the change is staged and uncommitted, `harness set <id> status=abandoned`, stop; the user decides what to do with the working tree |
| a question | answer it, re-print the options line |

No next-step suggestions, no offers, no routing chatter: the fast lane ends when the change is in or the user has said no.
