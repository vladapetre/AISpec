# Ordering, step 3: the user gate

`harness next <id>` said `approve_phase` by user, with `phase: n` and `options`. This is the one place the lane stops. Print the packet, send a push notification when the tool exists, and end the turn.

The packet is rendered by code from the developer's saved block, so it has the same shape and width every time:

```
node .claude/bin/harness.mjs packet <id>
```

Print its output verbatim, as plain lines, nothing before it and nothing after it: no summary of the plan, no restatement of the contract, no advice on which option to pick. It looks like this:

```
▶ phase 1/2 done · 20260914-rc-7287-stop-poll-write
  The telematics poll can no longer write TANKINHOUD on either cycle.

Apply the reply, then continue in the same turn:

| Reply | Command | Then |
|---|---|---|
| `a`, `approved`, `ok`, `yes` | `harness route <id> --verdict approved --agent user --phase <n>` | `harness next`: next phase or review |
| `r <m>`, `approved through <m>`, `run to <m>` | `harness route <id> --verdict approved --agent user --phase <n> --through <m>` | continue the developer with `run through <m>` |
| `x <why>`, `reject: <why>`, anything else with a reason | `harness route <id> --verdict rejected --agent user --phase <n> --reason "<why>"` | `SendMessage` the developer: `work: <id>`, `phase: <n>`, `rejected: <why verbatim>` |
| a question | answer it | re-render the packet |

A reply that is neither an approval, a run grant, a rejection with a reason, nor a question is asked back once: "approve, run through, or reject with a reason?" Silence is not approval.

Never two packets in a row without a reply in between, and never a packet for a phase whose `PHASE DONE` block you have not seen.
