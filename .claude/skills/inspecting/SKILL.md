# Inspecting

`/inspecting [<work-id>] [--session <id>]`

Work items:

!`node .claude/bin/harness.mjs list --human`

Cost, this project:

!`node .claude/bin/harness.mjs cost --human`

## Steps

1. With no id: print the two lines above, then for each `open` item one line from `harness next <id> --human`. Stop.
2. With an id: `harness state <id>` and `harness next <id> --human`, plus `harness cost --work <id> --human`. Render:

```
▶ <id> · <lane> · <status> · phases <approved>/<total>
Next: <action> by <actor><, phase n>
Spent: $<cost> · <turns> turns · cache <ratio> · <tok/line> tokens per accepted line
Verdicts: <last three, oldest first>
```

3. Answer the specific question the user asked in one more line if the render does not already; never restate the artifact.

The ledger is `.claude/ledger/ledger.jsonl`, written by the hooks; this skill only reads what `harness cost` computes from it. An empty ledger means no turn has completed in this project since the hooks were installed.
